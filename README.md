HKUST x JP Morgan Fintech Mentorship Program: Income Regression and Classification Models

- Two regression and two classification models that predict Income based on Experience and Age

- Learning Objectives: conduct regression (linear & ridge regression) and classification analysis (logistic regression & decision tree)
    - Specifications: regression analysis has detailed documentation, while classification analysis is just functions
- Python Libraries: sklearn, pandas, seaborn, numpy
    - Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Logisitic Regression, Decision Tree
- Improvements: extensively tune hyperparameters of ridge regression, logistic regression, and decision tree to reduce overfitting, consider using polynomial regression modeling
